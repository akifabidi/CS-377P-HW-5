Parts 1 - 4 and 6- 8 are in pi.c Part 5 is in part5.cpp.
To change between the number of threads for any part, you can change the value of the MAX_THREADS definition in that appropriate file.
To compile parts 1 - 4 and 6 - 8, use 'make cprog'. To run these parts, use 'make run'.
To run part 1, comment everything out of the main function aside from the function call to the method part1. Then compile and run with make instructions.
To run part 2, comment everything out of the main function aside from the function call to the method part2. Then compile and run with make instructions.
To run part 3, uncomment the code under "general initialization" and "general code" aside from the "sum[i] = 0" code. The p_thread create should have part3 method as the third parameter. Then compile and run with make instructions.
To run part 4, uncomment the code under "general initialization" and "general code" aside from the "sum[i] = 0" code. The p_thread create should have part4 method as the third parameter.
Uncomment the mutex intialization line as well in the main function. Then compile and run with make instructions.
To compile part 5, use 'make part5'. To run this part, use 'make runPart5'.
To run part 6, uncomment the code under "general initialization" and "general code". Include the "sum[i] = 0" code to initialize the values of the sum array to 0. The p_thread create should have part6 method as the third parameter. Then compile and run with make instructions.
To run part 7, uncomment the code under "general initialization" and "general code". Include the "sum[i] = 0" code to initialize the values of the sum array to 0. The p_thread create should have part78 method as the third parameter. Then compile and run with make instructions.
To run part 8, uncomment the code under "general initialization" and "general code". Include the "sum[i] = 0" code to initialize the values of the sum array to 0. The p_thread create should have part78 method as the third parameter. Uncomment the barrier initialization in the main function and the barrier wait in part7 method. Then compile and run with make instructions.
